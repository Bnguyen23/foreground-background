What the makefile has insde it:

Please move the Matlab scripts into your Matlab's folder on your desktop and make changes in the makefile according to your computer specs.

1. To use Matlab's script videoreader.m to extract from the video changing mov. to BMP files.
2. Once the video has been changed, it needs to be transferred into the IDE folder "test_data".
3. Then once the folder contains the BMP files then please change the number of frames you would like to run in the foreground.java
4. Once that is changed to your desired frames, then run foregound.java
5. Due to the large files it takes about a day and half to run.
6. Once the code has finished, it'll have the output data in the test_output folder.
7. Then run the Matlab script videowriter.m
